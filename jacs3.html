<p><a href="#jacs3"><h4>Medicine &amp; dentistry</h4></a></p>
<p>Medicine and dentistry encompass a broad range of healthcare practices that are vital for maintaining and restoring health. These fields involve the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Medicine typically focuses on the entire human body and its complex systems, while dentistry concentrates on oral health, including the teeth, gums, and related structures. Programs designed broadly within these areas provide a comprehensive understanding of health sciences, integrating knowledge and skills that apply to both medical and dental care. These programs often serve as a foundation for further specialization in specific areas of health and medicine.</p>

It emphasizes individual entrepreneurship, private property rights, and minimal government intervention in economic matters. The capitalist system is characterized by a competitive marketplace, where goods and services are traded freely, and investment and production decisions are driven by the pursuit of profit. The benefits of capitalism are often noted as fostering innovation, providing a wide array of choices for consumers, and promoting efficiency and economic growth. Critics, however, argue that it can lead to inequalities in wealth and power, and can prioritize profit over social good.</p>

<p><a href="#jacs3"><h4>Monetarism</h4></a></p>
<p>Monetarism is an economic theory primarily concerned with the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation. Originating from the work of economist Milton Friedman, monetarism posits that variations in the money supply have major influences on national output in the short run and the price level over longer periods. Monetarists argue that the main driver of economic growth and inflation is the supply of money, and they believe that controlling this supply through monetary policy can regulate inflation and contribute to economic stability. Monetarism gained significant attention in the late 20th century, particularly during periods of high inflation, and has shaped central banking policies worldwide, particularly those focusing on targeting inflation rates.</p>

<p>Keynesianism is an economic theory that argues for government intervention to help moderate the ups and downs of the business cycle. Developed by British economist John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression, it suggests that during periods of economic downturn, increased government spending and lower taxes can stimulate demand and pull an economy out of recession. Keynesian economics contrasts with classical economic theories that advocate for minimal government interference. It emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in influencing economic output and employment levels.</p>

<p>Collectivism is a socio-economic ideology that emphasizes the interdependence and collective control over the means of production within a society. It contrasts with individualism and is often associated with socialist and communist theories where the focus is on the needs and goals of the group rather than those of the individual. Collectivism prioritizes the welfare of the whole community, often promoting state or communal ownership and management of resources and production. It is argued that collectivist societies can achieve greater economic equality, social cohesion, and solidarity, vs. the competitive and often unequal nature of capitalist systems. However, critics argue that it can lead to inefficiency, lack of innovation, and infringement on individual freedoms.</p>

<p><a href="#jacs3"><h4>Phonetics &amp; phonology</h4></a></p>
<p>Phonetics and Phonology are subfields of linguistics that focus on the study of speech sounds. Phonetics is the science of the physical sounds of human speech, examining their production, acoustic properties, and auditory perception. It deals with the articulatory and acoustic features of speech, such as how sounds are formed in the vocal tract and how they are transmitted as sound waves. Phonology, on the other hand, focuses on the way sounds function in specific languages or dialects as part of a language's abstract sound system or phoneme inventory. It explores patterns, rules, and systems that govern how sounds interact with each other and are organized in the minds of speakers. Phonetics provides the empirical data and descriptive tools, while phonology analyzes the cognitive aspects and theoretical representations of these sounds in a given language.</p>

<p>Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that focuses on the study of speech sounds. It involves the physical production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological processes associated with speech. Phonetics provides the tools to describe and categorize sounds not only in human language but also examines the distinctions between the sounds of different languages. This field is vital for understanding accents, language acquisition, and the artificial synthesis of speech. Phonetics is deeply interconnected with phonology, the study of how sounds function within a particular language or languages.</p>

<p><a href="#jacs3"><h4>Stone Age</h4></a></p>
<p>The Stone Age is a prehistoric period characterized by the development and use of stone tools and covers a vast timeline from the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins approximately 3.3 million years ago to around 3300 BCE, transitioning to the Bronze Age as metal tools became prevalent. Archival records from this era are scarce, so archaeology provides insight into human evolution, social organization, subsistence strategies, and cultural development through excavated artifacts, cave paintings, and megalithic structures.
